# Arduino-Javascript-HTML
Repository to show how to connect javascript with Arduino and HTML at the same time.


You should run server.js in the command console with NODE.

Then open index.html which will automatically connect to the server in your own computer and run the code.

The arduino code just has to send numers through serial with Serial.println(whatever);
